                        <p>var declarations have function-level scope, which means they are only accessible within the
                              function in which they are defined.
                              If a var is defined inside a function, it cannot be accessed outside of that function.
                              However, if a var is defined outside of any function, it becomes a global variable and can
                              be
                              accessed from anywhere in the script.
                              var declarations are also hoisted, which means they are moved to the top of their
                              containing
                              function or global scope during compilation. This can sometimes lead to unexpected
                              behavior.</p>

                  <div class="card-body">
                        <h2 class="card-title">LET</h2>
                        <p>let declarations have block-level scope, which means they are only accessible within the
                              block (e.g., inside a loop or if statement) in which they are defined.
                              Variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of their containing block, so they
                              are only accessible after they have been declared.
                              This block-level scope provides better control and helps prevent unintended variable
                              redeclarations or modifications outside of the intended block.</p>

                        <p>const declarations also have block-level scope, just like let.
                              However, const variables are meant to be constant. Once assigned a value, they cannot be
                              reassigned to a different value.
                              This makes const useful for declaring variables that should remain unchanged throughout
                              their scope.
                              It's important to note that while the value of a const variable is immutable, the object
                              it references can still be modified.</p>

                        <h2 class="card-title">null</h2>
                        <p>null is explicitly assigned to a variable or used as a value to indicate that the variable
                              intentionally does not have a value or an object reference.
                              It is often used when you want to represent the absence of a value or the idea that a
                              variable should have no value.
                              Common use cases for null include:
                              Initializing a variable that is expected to hold an object or value later in the code.
                              Indicating that an object property intentionally has no value.
                              Checking if a function or operation returned a meaningful result or encountered an error.

                        <p>undefined typically represents a variable or object property that has been declared but has
                              not been assigned any value.
                              It can also be the default return value of a function that doesn't explicitly return
                              anything.
                              Use cases for undefined include:
                              Variables that have been declared but not initialized.
                              Function parameters that have not been provided with a value.
                              Accessing object properties that do not exist.</p>

                        <p>
                              A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of
                              rules and principles for creating web services. It emphasizes statelessness, using HTTP
                              methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform actions on resources identified by
                              URLs. Resources can have different representations, such as JSON or XML. REST APIs are
                              widely used for building web services that can be accessed by various clients, enabling
                              scalable and interoperable communication over the internet. They promote a uniform and
                              structured approach to designing APIs, making them a popular choice for developing modern,
                              distributed systems and enabling interaction between different software applications.</p>
